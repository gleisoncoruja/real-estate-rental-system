# About
<p>The idea of Aluguel de Pobre came up after noticing the typical questions asked on social networks looking for
                 cheap real estate in middle-class neighborhoods.
                 Most rental sites are geared towards properly regularized properties, properties with
                 long months contract, but we middle class people are used to
                 rent a house with a "mouth contract" or as it is also known as a "drawer contract".
</p>
<p>But what about the name Aluguel de Pobre?</p>
<p>The site's name was strategically thought to cause a buzz, it's easy to stick, it's suggestive,
     can become a topic in the circle of friends even if I like "just kidding", but that with
     sure when thinking about renting a good and cheap house, the name Aluguel de Pobre will soon come to mind, this
     facilitate "word of mouth" dissemination.
</p>

<p>We know that a popular rental is usually dealt with directly with the owner (landlord) and that there is no
     a lot of bureaucracy, some charge a deposit which is a type of guarantee in case there is
     any damage to the residence after the tenant leaves, or if the tenant becomes unemployed,
     or if you decide to leave the property, so you will still have a few months already paid, in addition to
     we know that there are no rental sites that accept houses in communities, on our platform it is
     possible you register a property and inform the name of the community. Putting all these together
     questions I decided to develop this simple and effective platform that will help both those who are looking for
     cheap rent as those who are looking to advertise their properties.
